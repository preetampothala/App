###### Project planning
Before I step in any further I wanted to focus on project planning phase so that I don’t encounter any problems while programming it.

User Stories -> Features -> Flow Chart -> Architecture

###### User Stories

Description of application functionalities from the user perspective.

###### Features
Features to implement in order to make the user stories work as intended.

###### Flowchart
Visualize the different actions that user can take and how the program reacts to the user actions in a flowchart. Also helps to visualize what I am going build.

###### Architecture
How to build. How to organize the code and what Swift programming features to use.
